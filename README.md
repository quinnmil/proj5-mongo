# Project 5: Brevet time calculator with Ajax and MongoDB

Simple list of controle times from project 4 stored in MongoDB database.

## What is in this repository

You have a minimal implementation of Docker compose in DockerMongo folder,
using which you can connect the flask app to MongoDB (as demonstrated in 
class). Refer to the lecture slide "05a-Mongo-Docker-Compose.pdf" (dated 
02/15/2018). 

## Functionality you'll add

You will reuse *your* code from project
4 (https://github.com/UOCIS322/proj4-brevets). Recall: you created a list
of open and close controle times using AJAX. In this project, you will create the 
following functionality. 1) Create two buttons ("Submit") and ("Display") in the page where have
controle times. 2) On clicking the Submit button, the control times should be
entered into the database. 3) On clicking the Display button, the entries from
the database should be displayed in a new page. 

Handle error cases appropriately. For example, Submit should return an error if
there are no controle times. One can imagine many such cases: you'll come up
with as many cases as possible.

## Tasks

You'll turn in your credentials.ini using which we will get the following:

* The working application.

* A README.md file that includes not only identifying information (your name,
  the path to your application on ix) but but also a revised, clear specification 
  of the brevet controle time calculation rules.

* Dockerfile

* Test cases for the two buttons. No need to run nose.

* docker-compose.yml
